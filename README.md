### 1.What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why?
  I choose MongoDb NOSQLdatabase.
  MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. 
  Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.
  Structure of a single object is clear.
  No complex joins.
  MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL.
  Ease of scale-out âˆ’ MongoDB is easy to scale.

### 2. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
  This was an extention of the porject 1 hence I had to just edit this code based on the requirement.
  
  
### 3. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
  Since I was working with MongoDb for the first time it was a little challenging but after studying both and understanding and with the help of articles found online the implementation over was not hard.
  Animation for the newly arriving data was tricky.
  
### 4. If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
  The reliability and the security for data in cloud is a big concern and in the Node.js we use lots of different libraries because Node.js doesn't provide you with that much. 
  Looking at API documentation for modules is therefore a must. Due to the fact that debugging tools are not great making use of new libraries can be a concern.
